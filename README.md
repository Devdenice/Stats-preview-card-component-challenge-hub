## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex

### What I learned

I learned to use the flex property to make a 2 column using the flex-direction

```css
.grid-item {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

### Continued development

I wanted to enhance the correct image accent color because in my final work the color from the project file doesn't match to the color that I had. This is the part were i experience difficulties because I can't match the same color as like in the final image provided.

- [Flex](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex.asp) - This helped me to make the column using the flex-direction. This will be helpful to someone new to flex property like me.
